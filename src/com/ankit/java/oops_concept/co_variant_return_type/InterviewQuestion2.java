/*
 * Explanation of Variable Hiding:
 * -------------------------------
 * - In Java, if a subclass declares a variable with the same name as
 *   one in its superclass, the superclass variable is hidden.
 *
 * - Access depends on the **reference type**, NOT the object type.
 *
 * Example:
 *   Derived derived = new Derived();
 *   System.out.println(derived.x);  // Uses Derived.x = 200
 *
 *   Base base = derived;  // Upcasting
 *   System.out.println(base.x);     // Uses Base.x = 100
 *
 * - Unlike method overriding (which is resolved at runtime via dynamic dispatch),
 *   variable hiding is resolved at compile time based on reference type.
