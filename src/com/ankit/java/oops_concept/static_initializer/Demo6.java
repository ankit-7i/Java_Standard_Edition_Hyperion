/*
 * Note:
 * If we donâ€™t declare a static field before the static block body execution (post declaration),
 * then we can perform only write operations (Initialization is possible due to prepare phase).
 * But read operation is not possible directly, otherwise we will get an error: Illegal forward reference.
 *
 * It is possible with class name because now the compiler knows that the variable is coming
 * from class area OR method area.
 *
 * Example:
 * static {
 *     x = 100;                     // Valid (write)
 *     System.out.println(x);       // Invalid (Illegal forward reference)
 *     System.out.println(ClassName.x); // Valid (read with class name)
 * }
 * static int x;
