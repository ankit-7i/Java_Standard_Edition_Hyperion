/*
 * Note:
 * Program on static block which shows that:
 * - Static block and static field both have the same priority during class loading.
 * - Both are executed at the time of class loading, before object creation.
 *
 * Execution flow:
 * 1. Class is loaded â†’ static fields + static blocks execute.
 * 2. Non-static block executes when an object is created.
 * 3. Constructor executes after non-static block.
 *
 * Example order:
 * - Static field initialization (Test t1 = new Test())
 * - Static block execution
 * - Non-static block execution (on object creation)
 * - Constructor execution
