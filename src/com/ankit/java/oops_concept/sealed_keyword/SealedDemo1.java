/*
 * Explanation of Sealed Classes:
 * -------------------------------
 * - 'sealed' restricts inheritance to only specific classes (declared in 'permits').
 * - 'non-sealed' removes restriction and allows further extension.
 * - 'final' prevents further extension.
 *
 * In this example:
 *   - Bird is sealed, only Parrot and Sparrow can extend it.
 *   - Parrot is non-sealed -> it can be extended by other classes.
 *   - Sparrow is final -> no class can extend Sparrow.
 *
 * âœ… Output:
 * Parrot Bird is flying..
 * Sparrow Bird is flying..
 *
 * Purpose of Sealed Classes:
 * --------------------------
 * - Provide more control over inheritance.
 * - Improve readability and maintainability by explicitly stating
 *   which classes are allowed in the hierarchy.
