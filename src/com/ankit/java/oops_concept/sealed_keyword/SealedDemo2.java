/*
 * Explanation of Sealed Classes in this Example:
 * ----------------------------------------------
 * - Payment is sealed -> only UPI, CreditCard, and DebitCard can extend it.
 * - UPI is 'final'     -> no further extension is allowed.
 * - CreditCard is 'non-sealed' -> other classes can extend it later (e.g., VisaCard, MasterCard).
 * - DebitCard is 'non-sealed'  -> can also be extended further.
 *
 * This enforces controlled hierarchy while still allowing flexibility.
 *
 * âœ… Output:
 * Making a payment of: 12000.0 via UPI
 * Making a payment of: 29000.0 via CreditCard
 * Making a payment of: 15000.0 via DebitCard
 *
 * Benefits:
 * ---------
 * - Provides strong control over inheritance.
 * - Makes class hierarchy explicit and safe.
 * - Useful in modeling domains (like payments) where valid child classes are limited.
