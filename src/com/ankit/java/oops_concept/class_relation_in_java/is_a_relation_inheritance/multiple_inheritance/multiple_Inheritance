Why Java does not support Multiple Inheritance using classes:

Definition:
Multiple Inheritance is when a subclass wants to inherit from two or more superclasses.

Problem (Diamond Problem):

Every constructor in Java automatically calls super() or this().

If a class inherits from two superclasses, the compiler faces ambiguity about which super() to call.

This leads to the Diamond Problem.

Conclusion:

Java does not allow multiple inheritance with classes.

Instead, Java achieves it using interfaces (since interfaces do not have constructors).

Key Point from Java Design:

Any new concept in Java must pass all test cases and provide valid results in all situations.

To avoid ambiguity, multiple inheritance through classes was avoided.
