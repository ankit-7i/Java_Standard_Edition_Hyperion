/**
 * Demonstration of instanceof operator without IS-A relation.
 * ------------------------------------------------------------
 * - instanceof requires that the reference type and the class/interface type
 *   must have some relationship (inheritance or implementation).
 * - If there is NO relation, the code will give a COMPILATION ERROR.
 *
 * Example:
 * Bird and Fish are two independent classes.
 * Checking (fish instanceof Bird) is invalid because Fish is not related to Bird.
