/**
 * Time Complexity of ArrayList Operations:
 * ----------------------------------------
 * 1. Insertion / Deletion (Middle or Beginning):
 *    - Time Complexity: O(n)
 *    - Reason: When inserting or deleting an element from the middle or beginning,
 *      all subsequent elements are shifted to maintain order.
 *      Hence, this operation is costly for large lists.
 *
 * 2. Insertion / Deletion (At the End):
 *    - Time Complexity: O(1) (Amortized)
 *    - Reason: Adding an element at the end does not require shifting.
 *      However, if the internal array is full, a new array is created and elements are copied (resize cost).
 *
 * 3. Retrieval (Using get(index)):
 *    - Time Complexity: O(1)
 *    - Reason: ArrayList implements RandomAccess, allowing direct access
 *      to any element by its index.
 *
 * Note:
 * -----
 * For frequent insertions or deletions in the middle of a list,
 * use LinkedList instead of ArrayList since LinkedList provides
 * better performance for such operations.
