/**
 * *** LinkedList Data Structure ***
 * ---------------------------------
 * LinkedList is a linear or sequential data structure that stores elements in the form
 * of Nodes, which are not stored in contiguous memory locations.
 *
 * - Each Node contains:
 *      1. Data (the value)
 *      2. Address/Reference of the next node (and optionally previous node)
 *
 * - Unlike ArrayList, LinkedList does not store elements in a fixed-size array.
 *   Each node is linked using pointers, making it more efficient for insertion and
 *   deletion operations in the middle or beginning of the list.
 *
 * - Since nodes are linked dynamically, LinkedList provides better performance for
 *   frequent insertions or deletions but slower access time (O(n)) for random retrieval.
 *
 * *** Types of LinkedList ***
 * 1. Singly LinkedList       → Nodes are linked in one forward direction only.
 * 2. Doubly LinkedList       → Nodes have links in both forward and backward directions.
 * 3. Circular LinkedList     → Last node points back to the first node.
 * 4. Circular Doubly LinkedList → Combination of both circular and doubly.
 *
 * Note:
 *  - 'APN' = Address of Previous Node
 *  - 'ANN' = Address of Next Node
